# UBIC Wallet

UBIC is a crypto-project that is meant to democratize money creation - minting new currency in favor of everyone, not only in favor of the financial sector. 

UBIC works like a basic income on a blockchain, but may also be implemented by other projects for KYC-applications. UBIC will soon allow reliable pseudonymous voting (one person, one vote) and other applications as well that require a functionality to avoid sybil attacks.

Sybil attacks - people recieving multiple basic incomes at once - are harder on UBIC then elsewhere because you are required to proof your uniqueness with a Non-transferable proof of Signatur-Knowledge connected to your unique E-Passport. 

Your identity is NOT revealed that way to other participants of the system. 

The UBIC-Smartphone-Wallet is still in an early stage but does provide all basic functionalities a Wallet requires. You can send transactions, receive them and register a passport in order to get your UBIC cryptoUBI.

If you like the idea of the project you can support its development on github: github.com/rgex/UBIC-android-wallet &
