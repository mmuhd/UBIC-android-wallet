This is a UBIC wallet for android smartphones. It is still in an early stage but does provide all the basic functionalities a wallet requires. You can recieve your unconditional basic income by scanning your E-Passport via NFC. Your Identity is NOT revealed that way, the Non-transferable proof of Signature Knowledge avoids anonymously the creation of sybil accounts. 
You can send transactions, receive them and register a passport in order to get your UBIC cryptoUBI.
